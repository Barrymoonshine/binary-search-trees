# Binary Search Tree project

## Summary

This project builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) in the console using a randomly generated array. The array is sorted, any duplicates are removed and used to build a BST.

Further tests are completed on the BST to test if it's balanced and log the tree in the console in the following traversal orders:

- Level order
- Pre order
- Post order
- In order

Finally the above process is also completed on what is initially an unbalanced tree.

Note: no front end has been created as part of this project, see index.js in the source folder for solutions to this problem.

This project was completed as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack javascript curriculum.

## Key learning points

- Implementing BSTs and inserting and deleting nodes
- Traversing BSTs using level order, pre order, post order and in order sorting methods
- What constitutes a balanced BST
